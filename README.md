Manually sorting files in the Downloads folder can be frustrating! To solve this, I built a File Organizer using Python that automatically moves files into categorized folders based on their extensions.

💡 Features:
✅ Scans the Downloads folder 📂
✅ Sorts files into folders (Images, Documents, Videos, etc.) 🏷
✅ Creates missing folders automatically 🏗
✅ Saves time & keeps workspace clean 🧹

🔧 Technologies Used: Python, OS Module, Shutil
